Previously, I have also researched news bias and classification with the NLP Tegmark Group at MIT and worked on Android app migration for Intune at Microsoft.",
        "On campus, I am the director of HackMIT, MIT's largest undergraduate hackathon, and Blueprint, a smaller-scale learnathon and hackathon for high schoolers. I am also involved in Global Research and Consulting (GRC), StartLabs, Women Business Leaders (WBL), and Club Tennis. In my spare time you can find me trying to learn to play the guitar, watching movies, or taking nature walks."
